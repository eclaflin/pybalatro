# Questions & Exploration

## Q1: How should the Card object store valid suits and faces?

- I debated whether constants should live inside or outside the class.
- Senior dev explained class-level constants — values tied to the class itself (e.g. Card.SUITS, Card.FACES).
- Decided to define SUITS as a list and FACES as a dictionary with detailed attributes (face_name, is_face, numeric_val).

## Q2: Should Card receive all attributes directly, or just a key to look them up?

- At first, I tried iterating through Card.FACES.items() and passing the dictionary into the constructor.
- That caused confusion: my __init__ expected a dict but got a tuple.
- After debugging, I realized the better pattern is to pass only the key ("A", "K", etc.), and let the Card class look up its own attributes.

## Q3: How do we enforce that a Card is valid?

- My original concern: each Card should know if its rank/suit is valid.
- With SUITS and FACES centralized as class constants, validity is baked in — if it’s not in the dictionary/list, you can’t construct it.
- This makes the Card self-aware and prevents bad data at creation time.

## Key Decisions

- Card Constants: Store SUITS as a list, FACES as a dictionary with attributes.
- Initialization: Constructor takes suit and face (key). Looks up all details internally.
- Validation: Card enforces validity by design.
- Representation: __repr__ outputs suit, face name, face flag, and numeric value for readability.
