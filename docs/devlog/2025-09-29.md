# Devlog: 2025-09-29

## 1. Goals for this session
- Implement the **Card class** with core attributes:
  - Suit, rank, and optional value
  - Simple string representation (`__str__`) for debugging/CLI

## 2. Work completed
- Created `Card` class with class-level constants for valid suits and faces.  
- Implemented `__init__` to accept `suit` and `face` (e.g., `"Hearts"`, `"K"`) and validate against constants.  
- Added `__repr__` to return a readable string with suit, face name, face flag, and numeric value.  
- Verified instantiation works correctly by looping through all suits and faces to generate cards.  

## 3. Decisions made / design notes
- Store `SUITS` as a class-level list, and `FACES` as a dictionary with attributes (`face_name`, `is_face`, `numeric_val`).  
- Constructor only accepts the face key (e.g., `"A"`, `"K"`) and looks up attributes from `FACES`.  
- Keeping the object lightweight but self-validating ensures cards can’t be created with invalid suits/faces.  
- `Card` enforces validity internally, instead of requiring external validation logic.  

## 4. Challenges / blockers
- Initially hit a `TypeError` because iteration over `FACES.items()` produced tuples, while `__init__` expected a dict.  
- Solved by changing the design: pass only the face key into the constructor, then perform the attribute lookup internally.  

## 5. Next steps / todo
- Consider adding a lightweight test suite for `Card` (e.g., ensuring `Card("Spades", "A")` produces expected values).  
- Begin implementing a `Deck` class that generates a standard 52-card deck by looping through `SUITS` and `FACES`.  

## 6. Misc notes / ideas
- Debugging this reminded me of how dict iteration works in Python: `for k, v in dict.items()` returns tuples.  
- This session reinforced the value of letting the object “own” its validation, rather than scattering that logic elsewhere.  
- Keeping constants in the class itself makes sense since `Card` is fundamentally different from Jokers/Consumables in the game.
